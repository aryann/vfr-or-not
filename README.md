# VFR or Not

VFR or Not is a quiz app that allows pilots to test their weather
interpretation skills. Users are presented with weather reports from
airports around the United States, and are asked to determine if
conditions allow operations under Visual Flight Rules.

Weather data are presented in the [METAR
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR) and come from
[aviationweather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar).

This app is not intended for flight planning purposes.
